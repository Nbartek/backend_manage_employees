# backend_manage_employees
Backend project for organizing employee groups done with spring and hybernate database

Simple backend done using Spring and Spring Boot 4.0. Database operations managed trough Hibernate   
There are signs of refactoring and that's because i orginally did bacnekd without Spring, just my own transactions with Hibernate
---
There are unit tests and mock tests to check functionality that is not implemented on frontend
